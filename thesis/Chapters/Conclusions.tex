\section{The Problem At Hand}
As the main objective was to find a solution to Copernicus problem of
describing its projects, Rheos is an answer to this projects main
goal. It is possible to describe computational project for Copernicus
and Rheos supports all current aspects of the Copernicus system.

As required Rheos is a text-based way of describing project networks
in the form of a descriptive domain-specific language. Rheos supports
arbitrary plug-ins, since you can describe how and what Copernicus
should execute. As long as Copernicus as access to that executable any
kind of plug-in is possible to use in Rheos.

Rheos is simple because of its limited capabilities. The point of the
DSL is to describe the project and not to execute or evaluate any
code, but it is still a powerful tool for the users.


\section{What Rheos Became}

\subsection{A New Approach}
Rheos is a completely new solution for input to systems type
Copernicus. The language is designed for Copernicus and its users, but
using it for different systems would probably not be productive. The
idea is to fast and easily understand and use Rheos as a minor step
when using a Copernicus system for computations, which is not the
purpose for other distributed processing systems. The need for a
solution like Rheos has probably not been encountered before
Copernicus was developed.

Packages like Hadoop has the intention of building application which
interfaces with a distributed processing system, which is not the
desired approach of Rheos and Copernicus.

\subsection{Programing Style}
Using Rheos for describing computational projects is a sort of
metaprogramming. Rheos describes and manipulates how a Copernicus
system should evaluate a project. It is not the intention for users
to think of it this way, but to just to supply a problem and get an
answer. Rheos meet this intention since the users describes workflows
and send them to a Copernicus system.

Rheos has a flow-based nature, which is necessary to correctly
describe projects in Copernicus. There are also some functional
aspects to the language, which makes describing projects easier and
provides a good overview of networks as the code will be dense.


\subsection{Powerful Description Language}
The DSL is stronger than just a set of macros. With Rheos it is
possible to express generic parallel algorithms which is not the case
with macros for just adding components and connections. Pre-defined
code would be easier for users to understand and use with the
definition and the type-system available. As the code describes
networks they it should be easier to understand what the network
actually look like. 

The strong type-system makes Rheos a much safer way of building
networks compared to the old input system where computations would
fail on runtime when Copernicus actually would build the project
networks. The polymorphism makes the type-system powerful for a
description language. It makes using pre-defined code much easier for
users, where they can for example map functions with any kind of
inputs.

\section{State of the Implementation}
While the Rheos never got to a state where it could be integrated with
Copernicus, and still has some implementation steps that needs to be
addressed, the project as a whole got very far. Over the course of the
last months, Rheos has evolved from just being a replacement for the
XML-description of Copernicus' input to a much more powerful
language. Much time was spent on design and re-design, which has both
advantages and disadvantages.
