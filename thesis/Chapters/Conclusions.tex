\chapter{Conclusions}
- more to be done before use, but close enough

- alot of time spent on design/re-design, which led to that we did not
come as far as we thought. We expected to have running version
intergtrated with Copernicus

- usful reuslt

- we are happy and the developers of Copernicus seems to be happy with
the result

- differences from other languages

- descriptive net

- strongly typed

- data-flow functional components

- meta programming

- more than just macros


% PROBLEM STATEMENT ANSWERS

- Rheos is a solution to the problem Copernicus had

- It is a text-based way to descrube projects for Copernicus

- Rheos is simple due to its limited descriptive nature (no
execution/evaluation).
