\chapter*{Abstract}

Many computations running on high-performing systems does not make use
of the performance available. This is the result of the computations
failing to achieve strong scaling.

Copernicus is a system for execution large sampling computations. This
was originally developed to run large scale bio-molecular
simulations. But the system needed a user-friendly way of describing
computational projects. The developers wanted an intuitive text based
input for the system.

This master's thesis describes a design and implementation of a domain
specific language to meet the need of a better input for
Copernicus. The language design is simple but still can represent the
desired computational projects. It has both a flow-based and
functional aspect which makes it a powerful descriptive language.
