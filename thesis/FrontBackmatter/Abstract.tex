\chapter*{Abstract}

Many computations running on high-performing systems do not make use
of the performance available. To solve this problem, software written
to achieve strong scaling is needed.

Copernicus is a system for execution of large-scale sampling tasks in
high-performance environments. It aims to achieve strong scaling,
regardless of underlying architecture. The system was originally
developed to run large scale bio-molecular simulations. However,
lacking an intuitive way of describing computational projects, the
developers felt a need for an user-friendly text-based input for
Copernicus.

This master's thesis describes a design and implementation of a
domain-specific language to meet the need of a suitable input
description for Copernicus. The language design is simple yet manages
to capture the abstract model of how a computational project is
executed. The language is strongly typed and inspired by elements from
both functional programming and data-flow languages, making Rheos a
powerful descriptive domain-specific language.
