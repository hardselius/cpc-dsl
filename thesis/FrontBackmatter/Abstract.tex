\chapter*{Abstract}

Many computations running on high-perfoming systems does not achieve
strong scaling, which is nessecary to make use of the performance
available.

COPERNICUS

The Copernicus system needed a user-friendly way of describing
computational projects. The developers wanted an intuitive text based
input for the system.

This master's thesis describes a design and implementation of a domain
specific language to meet the need of a better input for
Copernicus. The language design is simple but still represents the
desired input for the system. As there were no resembling solution to
the problem, the language is inspired by imperative languages
like \emph{C}.
